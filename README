This is a very old trainer of mine that was written for MapleStory GMS v95.3. All source is included along with a very minor address/value table from Cheat Engine. This trainer was downloaded and distributed on the SNSGaming forums with a rough throughput of about 100,000 downloads in just a matter of a couple of nights. 

The source is here for everybody to learn how to manipulate memory in a very simple, easy manner. My very own hooking algorithm (now outdated) is also included in the complete source. Happy hacking!
